# Simple Participation Optimized Governance (SPOG)

A SPOG, "Simple Participation Optimized Governance," is a governance mechanism that uses token voting to maintain lists and manage communal property. As its name implies, it primarily optimizes for token holder participation. A SPOG is primarily used for **permissioning actors** and should not be used for funding/financing decisions.
